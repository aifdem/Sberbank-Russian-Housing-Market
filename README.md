# Sberbank-Russian-Housing-Market
This repository contains my solution for Kaggle's Sberbank Russian Housing Market competition. The goal of this competition was to develop predictive models to estimate housing prices in the Russian market accurately. I worked on this project from February to March, exploring various regression models and ensembles to improve the prediction accuracy.

## Results
After rigorous experimentation and refinement, my final solution achieved a Kaggle score of 0.33345. While I'm satisfied with the progress made during this period, there's always room for improvement, and As I become more acquainted with additional algorithms and techniques I plan to continue refining my approach to enhance prediction accuracy.
