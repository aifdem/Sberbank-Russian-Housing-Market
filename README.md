# Sberbank-Russian-Housing-Market
This repository contains my solution for Kaggle's Sberbank Russian Housing Market competition. The goal of this competition was to develop predictive models to estimate housing prices in the Russian market accurately. I worked on this project from February to March, exploring various regression models and ensembles to improve the prediction accuracy.
